# Village of Concern

In everyday life we face a constant barrage of potentially stressful situations,
experiences, and circumstances. These realities can fill us with anxiety, trepidation and
other negative feelings. Our game explores those situations and emotions in a lighthearted
manner but also shows they can devour us from the inside out.

## Description

Village of Concern was made by a group of five VCU students. Four of those students were majoring in VCU Arts while the fifth was majoring in computer science. These four students colaborated in building a game from the ground up that explores a virtual world. The four art students designed most of the landscape, sound, characters and layout while the fifth student took care of the technical aspects of the project. This inviled setting up Unity Coloborate, writing the C# scripts and designing all the functionality inside the virtual world.
